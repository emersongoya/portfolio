## Custom Domain Configuration

This portfolio is configured to use the custom domain **emersongoya.com**.

### Steps to Complete Domain Setup:

1. **GitHub Pages Configuration** (Already Done ✓)
   - CNAME file created with `emersongoya.com`
   - `.nojekyll` file added for proper rendering

2. **DNS Configuration** (Required)
   Configure the following DNS records with your domain registrar:
   
   **For Apex Domain (emersongoya.com):**
   - Type: A
   - Name: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
   - Value: Add these GitHub Pages IP addresses:
     - 185.199.108.153
     - 185.199.109.153
     - 185.199.110.153
     - 185.199.111.153
   
   **For WWW Subdomain (www.emersongoya.com):**
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: www
   - Value: emersongoya.github.io
   
3. **GitHub Repository Settings** (Required)
   - Go to: `https://github.com/emersongoya/portfolio/settings/pages`
   - Under "Custom domain", verify that `emersongoya.com` is entered
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS" once DNS propagates (wait 24-48 hours)

4. **DNS Propagation**
   - DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to propagate
   - Test with: `nslookup emersongoya.com` or `dig emersongoya.com`

### Troubleshooting:
- If the site doesn't load, verify DNS records are correct
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Check that the CNAME file contains only `emersongoya.com` (no http:// or https://)
- Wait for DNS propagation before enabling HTTPS
